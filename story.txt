You travel to the prairie and see a squirrel chomping on acorns. You grab your
camera to snap a picture and suddenly the squirrel jumps at you and grabs your
camera. The squirrel runs away, clutching your camera. The CIA was tired of having
its cameras stolen; they were commissioned by President Trump to launch a
clandestine airstrike campaign against American squirrels. By the time the public 
gained awareness concerning the scale of the campaign, it was long over. 
99% of squirrels were extinct, as well as 60% percent of rodent species.
The ecosystem collapse caused environmental collapse, and the removal of ozone
from Earth's atmosphere. In time, the UV rays which bathed the Earth's surface
would drive humanity's descendants underneath the Earth's crust, and into the sea.
