A Squirrel Story

You travel to the prairie and see a squirrel chomping on acorns. You grab your
camera to snap a picture and suddenly the squirrel jumps at you and grabs your
camera. The squirrel runs away, clutching your camera. You are very sad since you had actually borrowed that camera from a friend and now you have to buy him a new camera. Life is tough, unexpected things happen.
