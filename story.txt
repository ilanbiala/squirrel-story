A Squirrel Story

You travel to the prairie and see a squirrel chomping on acorns. You grab your
camera to snap a picture and suddenly the squirrel jumps at you and grabs your
camera. The squirrel runs away, clutching your camera.
the end... OR IS IT!!!

THE SQUIRREL THEN REVEALS ITSELF AS SUBRA SURESH, OUR LOST LORD AND SAVIOR,
AND CONTINUES TO FIGHT YOU UNTIL YOU AGREE TO PAY 3% HIGHER TUITION RATES!!!!
the end.
