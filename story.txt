A Squirrel Story

You travel to the prairie and see a squirrel chomping on acorns. You grab your
camera to snap a picture and suddenly the squirrel jumps at you and grabs your
camera. The squirrel runs away, clutching your camera.
You look down and notice a piece of folded paper on the ground left by the squirrel.
You bend over to pick it up.
When you unfold the paper, you see the classic troll face.
