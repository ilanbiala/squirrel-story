A Squirrel Story

You travel to the prairie and see a squirrel chomping on acorns. You grab your
camera to snap a picture and suddenly the squirrel jumps at you and grabs your
camera. The squirrel runs away, clutching your camera. You notice that the squirrel
left his acorns, though, so you are the real winner here.
