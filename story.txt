A Squirrel Story

You travel to the prairie and see a squirrel chomping on acorns. You grab your
camera to snap a picture and suddenly the squirrel jumps at you and grabs your
camera. The squirrel runs away, clutching your camera. The squirrel proceeds to take a selfie, afterwards dropping the camera. You recover your camera, and proceed to license the right to use the image for a small fee. PETA, then sues you over the copyright, alleging that it is the property of the squirrel, and hence you do not have the right to license the use of the squirrel's selfie.
