A Squirrel Story

You travel to the prairie and see a squirrel chomping on acorns. You grab your
camera to snap a picture and suddenly the squirrel jumps at you and grabs your
camera. The squirrel runs away, clutching your camera. You run after the squirrel
and politely ask for it back. The squirrel relents, and returns you your camera.
